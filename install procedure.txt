The start scripts use tmux to wrap the server process into a session.
The tmux session can then be detached from the terminal, allowing the terminal to be closed.
Without this the terminal would need to stay open to keep the server up.

run the inculded tmux wrapper script to run the server.
	./mc-session-start

to detach the session
	press control-b, then d

you can now close the terminal session
	the mc server continues to run in the background

to re-attach to the tmux session for interactive minecraft console:
	tmux attach -t mcserver
